                        <h5>Overview</h5>
                        <p>
                            According to the California law, bicyclists on the road have the same responsibilities 
                            and rights as do motorized vehicles. When a bicyclist collides with a car or 
                            other motorized vehicle, the cyclist can suffer severe injuries and even death 
                            due to negligent and distracted drivers. 
                            <br>
